dotfiles
========

These are the dotfiles of the Starship Caleb Hearth. Its continuing mission: to
explore strange new software, to seek out new configurations and new
customizations, to boldly go where hopefully lots of folks have gone before.

These dotfiles use GNU Stow combined with a Makefile to manage symlinks and to
combine configurations such as Brewfile entries from various packages.
